As the last generations who lived in the Valley, \nmany of us did not get the chance to experience our culture in its full richness , the \nlanguage, the rituals, the customs , and much of it is no longer practiced as it once was. \n1. Festivals Like No Other \nKashmiri Pandit festivals are distinct from the rest of India. From Herath (Shivratri) to \nNavreh, every celebration has a deep spiritual and cultural significance. \n• Herath: A night-long celebration of Lord Shiva with unique rituals, fasting, and \nceremonial offerings. \n• Navreh: The New Year is celebrated with special prayers, local delicacies, and \nofferings to nature. \nEven though these festivals are ancient, they are celebrated differently than in mainstream \nIndia, making them a treasure of our heritage. \n2. Food with Logic and Mythology \nKashmiri Pandit cuisine is famous for being non-vegetarian, but it’s not just for taste. \n• Scientific logic: Non-veg meals provide protein and energy needed for the cold \nclimate of Kashmir. \n• Mythological logic: Certain rituals and offerings require meat, keeping ancient \nspiritual practices intact. \nOur food, like our festivals, blends practical wisdom with cultural depth. \n3. Weddings: A Divine Celebration \nKashmiri Pandit weddings are entirely different from mainstream Indian weddings. \n• The groom is treated as Lord Shiva, and the bride as Maa Shakti. \n• Every ritual symbolizes the cosmic balance between divine masculine and feminine \nenergies. \n• Weddings are deeply spiritual, blending mythology, tradition, and community \ncelebration. \n4. Resilience Through History \nThe turmoil of 1990 forced every Kashmiri Pandit to start life from level one , leaving \nhomes, careers, and everything familiar. \nYet today, we have reached new heights in education, careers, and cultural preservation. \nThis resilience and ability to rebuild is a testament to the spirit of Kashmiri Pandits. \n5. The Kashmiri Pandit Personality \nKashmiri Pandits are soft-spoken, sensible, and thoughtful. \nYou will rarely see a Kashmiri Pandit fight or raise their voice unnecessarily. There’s a calm \nwisdom in our community , a combination of deep learning, tradition, and respect for life. \nConclusion \nKashmiri Pandit culture is a beautiful, intricate tapestry of rituals, festivals, food, and \nwisdom. Though much of it is fading, it remains a source of identity, pride, and \ninspiration. \nFrom our unique festivals to our spiritual weddings, from our cuisine to our resilience, \nKashmiri Pandits are keepers of a legacy that the world should never forget. \nWe are a people who have survived upheaval, preserved knowledge, and still embody \ngrace, humility, and wisdom , truly a culture worth celebrating and preserving.\n    `\n}, {\n  title: \"Spiritual Learning in Kashmir\",\n  content: `\nKashmir is famous not only for its breathtaking landscapes but also for its ancient spiritual \ntraditions. Among these, Kashmir Shaivism stands out as a deeply philosophical and \nmystical path that blends ritual, meditation, and self-awareness. \nFor centuries, Kashmiri Pandits have preserved this spiritual heritage, making it one of the \nmost unique and profound systems of learning in the world. \n1. What is Kashmir Shaivism? \nKashmir Shaivism is a branch of Hindu philosophy that focuses on Shiva as the supreme \nconsciousness , the source and essence of the universe. Unlike other Shaivite traditions, it \nemphasizes: \n• Recognition of the self as divine \n• Integration of spirituality into daily life \n• Meditation and ritual as tools for self-realization \nIt’s not just philosophy; it’s a practical guide to living with awareness and consciousness. \n2. Rituals and Practices \nRituals play a central role in Kashmiri spiritual life. Some of the key practices include: \n• Herath (Shivratri): A night-long fasting and vigil to worship Lord Shiva, with \nceremonial offerings and prayers. \n• Daily Puja: Even in homes, families maintain small altars for daily prayers, often \naccompanied by mantras and devotional songs. \n• Seasonal Offerings: Specific rituals mark different seasons, connecting humans with \nnature and the cosmic rhythm. \nThese rituals are not mere formalities; they are meant to align the mind, body, and soul \nwith universal consciousness. \n3. Meditation and Inner Learning \nBeyond rituals, Kashmir Shaivism emphasizes self-reflection, meditation, and experiential \nlearning. \n• Texts by scholars like Abhinavagupta explore consciousness, aesthetics, and the \nunity of life. \n• Spiritual practices include yoga, pranayama, and contemplation to awaken inner \nawareness. \n• Learning is experiential, meaning knowledge is gained through practice and self\nrealization rather than just reading. \n4. Integration of Spirituality and Life \nOne of the most unique aspects of Kashmiri Shaivism is that spirituality is not separate \nfrom daily life. \n• Work, family, and community are all seen as part of spiritual practice. \n• Art, music, and poetry are infused with spiritual meaning. \n• Every action, when performed mindfully, is a step toward self-realization. \nThis holistic approach ensures that spiritual learning is practical and life-affirming. \n5. Modern Relevance \nEven today, these teachings are highly relevant. They encourage: \n• Self-awareness and mindfulness \n• Harmony with nature and community \n• Inner balance and resilience \nKashmir Shaivism shows that spirituality is not about renunciation alone but about living \nfully with consciousness, purpose, and devotion. \nConclusion \nSpiritual learning in Kashmir is a journey of ritual, meditation, and inner awakening. It is \ndeeply rooted in tradition but remains timeless and practical, offering tools for anyone \nseeking a deeper understanding of life and consciousness. \nThrough its rituals, philosophy, and emphasis on experiential learning, Kashmir Shaivism \ncontinues to guide generations toward self-realization and harmony with the universe.    `\n}];\nexport default function BlogSelectionPanel() {\n  _s();\n  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null);\n  return /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"section\", {\n    className: \"blog-panel\",\n    children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n      className: \"blog-panel-title\",\n      children: \"Blog & Story Library\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 275,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n      className: \"blog-selection-list\",\n      children: BLOGS.map((blog, idx) => /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(motion.button, {\n        className: `blog-selector${activeIndex === idx ? \" active\" : \"\"}`,\n        onClick: () => setActiveIndex(idx),\n        whileHover: {\n          scale: 1.06\n        },\n        whileTap: {\n          scale: 0.99\n        },\n        children: blog.title\n      }, idx, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 278,\n        columnNumber: 11\n      }, this))\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 276,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(AnimatePresence, {\n      children: activeIndex !== null && /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(motion.div, {\n        className: \"blog-content-frame\",\n        initial: {\n          opacity: 0,\n          y: 40\n        },\n        animate: {\n          opacity: 1,\n          y: 0\n        },\n        exit: {\n          opacity: 0,\n          y: 40\n        },\n        transition: {\n          duration: 0.33\n        },\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n          className: \"blog-close-btn\",\n          onClick: () => setActiveIndex(null),\n          children: \"\\xD7 Close\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 298,\n          columnNumber: 13\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"pre\", {\n          className: \"blog-content-text\",\n          children: BLOGS[activeIndex].content\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 301,\n          columnNumber: 13\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 291,\n        columnNumber: 11\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 289,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 274,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n_s(BlogSelectionPanel, \"E8kOn+IkK/htiBGEqJWkEvOqULU=\");\n_c = BlogSelectionPanel;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"BlogSelectionPanel\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","useState","motion","AnimatePresence","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","BLOGS","title","content","BlogSelectionPanel","_s","activeIndex","setActiveIndex","className","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","map","blog","idx","button","onClick","whileHover","scale","whileTap","div","initial","opacity","y","animate","exit","transition","duration","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["C:/Users/abhin/Desktop/sugam-portfolio/src/BlogSelectionPanel.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport { motion, AnimatePresence } from \"framer-motion\";\r\n\r\n// Paste the full text of each blog between the backticks below (or import from .txt files)\r\nconst BLOGS = [\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"My First 60 Days in Ireland\",\r\n    content: `\r\n (aka: How Reality Slapped Me Cold , But I Still Love It)\r\n Before coming to Ireland, I had a full Bollywood fantasy playing in my head.\r\n I imagined myself studying with students from all over the globe, travelling every weekend,\r\n getting a part-time job in a few weeks, and living my “international student” dream life.\r\n Then Ireland opened the door and said:\r\n “Welcome.

From Herath (Shivratri) to \r\nNavreh, every celebration has a deep spiritual and cultural significance. \r\n• Herath: A night-long celebration of Lord Shiva with unique rituals, fasting, and \r\nceremonial offerings. \r\n• Navreh: The New Year is celebrated with special prayers, local delicacies, and \r\nofferings to nature. \r\nEven though these festivals are ancient, they are celebrated differently than in mainstream \r\nIndia, making them a treasure of our heritage. \r\n2. Food with Logic and Mythology \r\nKashmiri Pandit cuisine is famous for being non-vegetarian, but it’s not just for taste. \r\n• Scientific logic: Non-veg meals provide protein and energy needed for the cold \r\nclimate of Kashmir. \r\n• Mythological logic: Certain rituals and offerings require meat, keeping ancient \r\nspiritual practices intact. \r\nOur food, like our festivals, blends practical wisdom with cultural depth. \r\n3. Weddings: A Divine Celebration \r\nKashmiri Pandit weddings are entirely different from mainstream Indian weddings. \r\n• The groom is treated as Lord Shiva, and the bride as Maa Shakti. \r\n• Every ritual symbolizes the cosmic balance between divine masculine and feminine \r\nenergies. \r\n• Weddings are deeply spiritual, blending mythology, tradition, and community \r\ncelebration. \r\n4. Resilience Through History \r\nThe turmoil of 1990 forced every Kashmiri Pandit to start life from level one , leaving \r\nhomes, careers, and everything familiar. \r\nYet today, we have reached new heights in education, careers, and cultural preservation. \r\nThis resilience and ability to rebuild is a testament to the spirit of Kashmiri Pandits. \r\n5. The Kashmiri Pandit Personality \r\nKashmiri Pandits are soft-spoken, sensible, and thoughtful. \r\nYou will rarely see a Kashmiri Pandit fight or raise their voice unnecessarily. There’s a calm \r\nwisdom in our community , a combination of deep learning, tradition, and respect for life. \r\nConclusion \r\nKashmiri Pandit culture is a beautiful, intricate tapestry of rituals, festivals, food, and \r\nwisdom. Though much of it is fading, it remains a source of identity, pride, and \r\ninspiration. \r\nFrom our unique festivals to our spiritual weddings, from our cuisine to our resilience, \r\nKashmiri Pandits are keepers of a legacy that the world should never forget. \r\nWe are a people who have survived upheaval, preserved knowledge, and still embody \r\ngrace, humility, and wisdom , truly a culture worth celebrating and preserving.\r\n    `\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Spiritual Learning in Kashmir\",\r\n    content: `\r\nKashmir is famous not only for its breathtaking landscapes but also for its ancient spiritual \r\ntraditions. Among these, Kashmir Shaivism stands out as a deeply philosophical and \r\nmystical path that blends ritual, meditation, and self-awareness. \r\nFor centuries, Kashmiri Pandits have preserved this spiritual heritage, making it one of the \r\nmost unique and profound systems of learning in the world. \r\n1. What is Kashmir Shaivism? \r\nKashmir Shaivism is a branch of Hindu philosophy that focuses on Shiva as the supreme \r\nconsciousness , the source and essence of the universe. Unlike other Shaivite traditions, it \r\nemphasizes: \r\n• Recognition of the self as divine \r\n• Integration of spirituality into daily life \r\n• Meditation and ritual as tools for self-realization \r\nIt’s not just philosophy; it’s a practical guide to living with awareness and consciousness. \r\n2. Rituals and Practices \r\nRituals play a central role in Kashmiri spiritual life. Some of the key practices include: \r\n• Herath (Shivratri): A night-long fasting and vigil to worship Lord Shiva, with \r\nceremonial offerings and prayers. \r\n• Daily Puja: Even in homes, families maintain small altars for daily prayers, often \r\naccompanied by mantras and devotional songs. \r\n• Seasonal Offerings: Specific rituals mark different seasons, connecting humans with \r\nnature and the cosmic rhythm. \r\nThese rituals are not mere formalities; they are meant to align the mind, body, and soul \r\nwith universal consciousness. \r\n3. Meditation and Inner Learning \r\nBeyond rituals, Kashmir Shaivism emphasizes self-reflection, meditation, and experiential \r\nlearning. \r\n• Texts by scholars like Abhinavagupta explore consciousness, aesthetics, and the \r\nunity of life. \r\n• Spiritual practices include yoga, pranayama, and contemplation to awaken inner \r\nawareness. \r\n• Learning is experiential, meaning knowledge is gained through practice and self\r\nrealization rather than just reading. \r\n4. Integration of Spirituality and Life \r\nOne of the most unique aspects of Kashmiri Shaivism is that spirituality is not separate \r\nfrom daily life. \r\n• Work, family, and community are all seen as part of spiritual practice. \r\n• Art, music, and poetry are infused with spiritual meaning. \r\n• Every action, when performed mindfully, is a step toward self-realization. \r\nThis holistic approach ensures that spiritual learning is practical and life-affirming. \r\n5. Modern Relevance \r\nEven today, these teachings are highly relevant. They encourage: \r\n• Self-awareness and mindfulness \r\n• Harmony with nature and community \r\n• Inner balance and resilience \r\nKashmir Shaivism shows that spirituality is not about renunciation alone but about living \r\nfully with consciousness, purpose, and devotion. \r\nConclusion \r\nSpiritual learning in Kashmir is a journey of ritual, meditation, and inner awakening. It is \r\ndeeply rooted in tradition but remains timeless and practical, offering tools for anyone \r\nseeking a deeper understanding of life and consciousness. \r\nThrough its rituals, philosophy, and emphasis on experiential learning, Kashmir Shaivism \r\ncontinues to guide generations toward self-realization and harmony with the universe.    `\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default function BlogSelectionPanel() {\r\n  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <section className=\"blog-panel\">\r\n      <h2 className=\"blog-panel-title\">Blog & Story Library</h2>\r\n      <div className=\"blog-selection-list\">\r\n        {BLOGS.map((blog, idx) => (\r\n          <motion.button\r\n            className={`blog-selector${activeIndex === idx ?
